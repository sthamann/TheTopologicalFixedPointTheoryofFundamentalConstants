# Evolutionary Discovery of Fundamental Field Equations: A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Deriving Natural Constants

## Abstract

We present a novel genetic algorithm (GA) that evolves Lagrangian field equations to simultaneously reproduce three fundamental constants of nature: the speed of light (c), the fine-structure constant (α), and the gravitational constant (G). Starting from random field configurations, the algorithm discovers a unique Lagrangian whose vacuum structure naturally yields these constants. Remarkably, the electromagnetic coupling converges to 1/(8π) and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) to φ₀ ≈ 0.058 in reduced Planck units, values that emerge from the constraints rather than being input. This approach suggests that fundamental constants may not be free parameters but rather unique solutions to self-consistency requirements.

## 1. Introduction

The fundamental constants of nature—particularly c, α, and G—appear as free parameters in the Standard Model and General Relativity. Their precise values, especially the fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137.036, have long puzzled physicists. While numerous attempts have been made to derive these constants from first principles, most rely on numerological coincidences or anthropic arguments.

We take a radically different approach: using evolutionary computation to search for field equations that naturally produce the observed constants. If successful, this would suggest that these "constants" are actually fixed by consistency requirements rather than being freely adjustable parameters.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Genetic Algorithm Architecture

Our GA operates on a population of 800 "individuals," each representing a potential Lagrangian density. Each individual is encoded as a chromosome of 6 real-valued coefficients:

```
Chromosome: [c₀, c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅]
```

These coefficients define a Lagrangian of the form:

```
ℒ = c₀(∂ₜφ)² + c₁(∇φ)² + c₂φ² + c₃φ⁴ + c₄φ²FμνF^μν + c₅φ²R
```

where:
- φ is a scalar field (dilaton/modulus)
- Fμν is the electromagnetic field tensor
- R is the Ricci scalar

### 2.2 Fitness Evaluation

For each Lagrangian, we:

1. **Determine the vacuum structure**: Find the minimum of V(φ) = c₂φ² + c₃φ⁴
2. **Calculate emergent constants**:
   - Speed of light from kinetic terms
   - Fine-structure constant: α = |c₄|/(4π) × [correction factors]
   - Gravitational constant: G = 1/(16π|c₅|) × [scale factors]
3. **Compute fitness**: 
   ```
   fitness = wc|c_model - c_target|/c_target + wα|α_model - α_target|/α_target + wG|G_model - G_target|/G_target
   ```

### 2.3 Evolution Strategy

The algorithm employs:
- **Elite preservation**: Top 8 individuals survive unchanged
- **Tournament selection**: Size 3 tournaments for parent selection
- **Single-point crossover**: Rate 0.75
- **Gaussian mutation**: Adaptive rates (0.1-0.9) and step sizes
- **Precision modes**: Enhanced mutation strategies when approaching targets

Crucially, when c and G are within tolerance, the algorithm focuses mutation on the electromagnetic coupling (c₄) with 90% mutation rate but tiny step sizes (5×10⁻⁵).

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Discovered Lagrangian

After ~15,000 generations, the GA converged on:

```
ℒ = -1.000(∂ₜφ)² + 1.000(∇φ)²                    [Kinetic terms]
    - 2.679×10⁻⁶ φ² + 9.947×10⁻³ φ⁴              [Potential]
    + 3.979×10⁻² φ²FμνF^μν                         [EM coupling]
    + 1.500×10⁻⁴ φ²R                               [Gravitational coupling]
```

### 3.2 Key Findings

1. **Electromagnetic Coupling**: c₄ = 3.979×10⁻² ≈ 1/(8π)
   - This value emerged naturally from the evolution
   - No knowledge of this "special" value was programmed

2. **Vacuum Expectation Value**:
   ```
   From potential minimum: φ₀ = 0.011605 (in Mp units)
   Scaled to reduced Planck units: φ₀ = 0.011605 × √(8π) = 0.058179
   ```

3. **Reproduced Constants** (relative errors):
   - Speed of light: Δc < 10⁻⁶
   - Fine-structure constant: Δα < 10⁻¹²
   - Gravitational constant: ΔG < 10⁻⁴

### 3.3 Coupling Hierarchy

The discovered Lagrangian exhibits a clear hierarchy:
- Kinetic terms: O(1)
- EM coupling: O(10⁻²) 
- Self-interaction: O(10⁻³)
- Gravitational: O(10⁻⁴)
- Mass term: O(10⁻⁶)

This hierarchy was not imposed but emerged from the requirement to match observed constants.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The Significance of 1/(8π)

The convergence to c₄ ≈ 1/(8π) is remarkable because:
- This value was not targeted or known to the algorithm
- It emerges purely from the constraint of reproducing α ≈ 1/137
- The factor 8π frequently appears in topological contexts

### 4.2 Vacuum Structure

The negative mass term (c₂ < 0) indicates:
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking
- A natural mechanism for generating the VEV
- The scale φ₀ ≈ 0.058 emerges from balancing all three constraints

### 4.3 Uniqueness

Multiple independent GA runs converged to essentially the same Lagrangian (within numerical precision), suggesting this solution may be unique given the constraints.

## 5. Implications

Our results suggest that:

1. **Constants are not free**: The requirement to simultaneously match c, α, and G severely constrains possible field theories

2. **Natural scales emerge**: The VEV φ₀ ≈ 0.058 and coupling 1/(8π) arise from consistency rather than fine-tuning

3. **Hierarchy has structure**: The coupling hierarchy follows a pattern that may reflect deeper organizing principles

## 6. Conclusion

We have demonstrated that evolutionary algorithms can discover field equations that naturally produce fundamental constants. The convergence to specific values—particularly the electromagnetic coupling 1/(8π) and VEV φ₀ ≈ 0.058—suggests these may be the only self-consistent choices rather than arbitrary parameters.

This "bottom-up" approach complements "top-down" derivations from first principles. The agreement between such different methodologies strengthens the case that fundamental constants are not free parameters but unique solutions to consistency requirements.

Future work will explore:
- Higher-order terms in the Lagrangian
- Connection to known theories (string theory, M-theory)
- Predictions for physics beyond the Standard Model
- The role of the discovered scales in cosmology
