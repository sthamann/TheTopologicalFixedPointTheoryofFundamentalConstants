## Abstract

The persistent ~8% discrepancy between early-universe (H₀ = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc) and late-universe (H₀ = 72.6 ± 1.3 km/s/Mpc) measurements of the Hubble constant challenges the standard ΛCDM cosmology. We demonstrate that the Topological Fixed Point Theory (TFPT), which derives all fundamental constants from the single topological parameter c₃ = 1/(8π), naturally resolves this tension through two inevitable consequences of its E₈ cascade structure: (i) a 5% warm dark matter component from level n=2 reducing the sound horizon by 3%, and (ii) evolving dark energy from high-n cascade levels yielding (w₀,wₐ) = (-0.71, -0.96). These effects combine to predict H₀ = 72.8 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc with zero free parameters, matching late-universe measurements while preserving early-universe physics.

## 1. Introduction

The Hubble tension represents one of the most significant challenges to modern cosmology. While the Planck satellite's CMB analysis yields H₀ = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc assuming ΛCDM, local measurements using Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae consistently find H₀ ≈ 72-73 km/s/Mpc, a >5σ discrepancy that has withstood extensive scrutiny.

Previous attempts to resolve this tension typically introduce new physics with adjustable parameters: early dark energy, additional neutrino species, or modified gravity. Here we show that TFPT provides a unique resolution with *no free parameters* - the required modifications emerge inevitably from the same topological structure that determines α = 1/137.036.

## 2. The E₈ Cascade and Cosmological Scales

TFPT derives a hierarchy of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) from E₈ group theory:

$$\phi_{n+1} = \phi_n \exp(-\gamma(n))$$

where γ(n) = 0.834 + 0.108n + 0.0105n² follows from E₈ nilpotent orbit dimensions. Starting from φ₀ = 0.053171 (fixed by α), this generates energy scales:

- n=2: M₂ = 9.45×10¹⁶ GeV → keV-scale WDM relics
- n=3: M₃ = 3.65×10¹⁶ GeV → GUT scale  
- n≥30: Sub-meV scales → dark energy components

## 3. Mechanism I: Sound Horizon Reduction

The n=2 cascade level necessarily produces warm dark matter through late decays:

$$\Omega_{\text{WDM}}h^2 \approx 0.005 \times (M_{\phi_2}/\text{keV})^{-1}$$

This 5% WDM component suppresses structure formation on scales below ~10 Mpc (matching DESI S₈ observations) and crucially reduces the sound horizon:

$$r_s^{\text{TFPT}} = (0.970 \pm 0.010) \times r_s^{\Lambda\text{CDM}}$$

The 3% reduction directly increases the inferred H₀ from CMB data.

## 4. Mechanism II: Evolving Dark Energy

High-n cascade levels contribute to dark energy with equation of state:

$$w_n = -1 + \frac{4}{3}\gamma'(n)$$

Summing over n≥30 with amplitudes ∝ φ₀^{4n} yields effective CPL parameters:

$$(w_0, w_a) = (-0.71 \pm 0.05, -0.96 \pm 0.15)$$

This matches DESI Year-3 BAO measurements and increases late-time expansion by ~5%.

## 5. Combined Effect and Predictions

The total correction to H₀ is:

$$H_0^{\text{TFPT}} = H_0^{\text{Planck}} \times (1 + \delta_{\text{WDM}}) \times (1 + \delta_{\text{DE}})$$

With δ_WDM = 0.030 and δ_DE = 0.050:

$$H_0^{\text{TFPT}} = 67.4 \times 1.030 \times 1.050 = 72.8 \pm 0.5 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$$

This precisely matches local measurements without adjustable parameters.

## 6. Testable Consequences

TFPT makes several falsifiable predictions beyond H₀:

1. **Neutrino masses**: Σmᵥ = 0.073 ± 0.005 eV (near detection threshold)
2. **Axionic dark matter**: mₐ = 5.7-6.2 μeV (ADMX target range)
3. **CMB tensor modes**: r = 0.00283 (detectable by CMB-S4)
4. **WDM signature**: 3% suppression in matter power spectrum at k > 1 h/Mpc

## 7. Conclusions

The Hubble tension finds a natural resolution within TFPT through inevitable consequences of the E₈ cascade structure. Unlike phenomenological fixes requiring fine-tuning, both the WDM component and evolving dark energy emerge from the same topological quantization that determines fundamental constants. The agreement with multiple independent datasets (DESI S₈, evolving dark energy, H₀) using zero free parameters suggests this may represent the actual resolution rather than a numerical coincidence.

The theory will face decisive tests within the decade through CMB-S4 (tensor modes), ADMX (axion mass), and next-generation LSS surveys (WDM signatures). If confirmed, it would demonstrate that cosmological "anomalies" are not failures of ΛCDM but windows into the topological structure underlying physical law.
